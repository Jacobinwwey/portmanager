### Purpose
Freeze one explicit review-packet template for `debian-12-systemd-tailscale`.
This document does not claim that parity already passed.
It names the artifact slots that must be filled before `/second-target-policy-pack` can move any blocked parity criterion.

### Packet header
- candidate target profile id
- candidate host id and Tailscale address
- operator name plus review date
- controller commit or release under review
- short drift summary, including any still-blocking mismatch

### Required evidence sections
1. Bootstrap transport parity
   - bootstrap operation id
   - bootstrap result summary
   - linked event replay or audit-index reference
   - confirmation that host target profile stayed `debian-12-systemd-tailscale`
2. Steady-state transport parity
   - one controller-driven mutation after bootstrap
   - resulting `/health` capture
   - resulting `/runtime-state` capture
   - linked controller operation or audit reference
3. Backup and restore parity
   - backup-bearing mutation id
   - backup manifest path
   - remote-backup result if configured
   - restore or restore-readiness note for the same packet
4. Diagnostics parity
   - diagnostics operation id
   - diagnostics artifact paths
   - linked event replay or audit-index reference
   - short operator note for any drift
5. Rollback parity
   - rollback-point id
   - rollback operation id
   - rollback result summary
   - post-rollback diagnostics linkage

### Publication rule
- Keep the packet in review-prep until every required section has real artifact links.
- If any section regresses, update `/second-target-policy-pack` first and keep support claims locked to Ubuntu.
- Link this packet back into the acceptance recipe and operator ownership note when evidence changes.
